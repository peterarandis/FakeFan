Arduino / ATtiny85 based solution to manipulate the fan speed reported to motherboard to make fan run slower. 
HP Omen Ryzen are running a little noicy even at non demanding tasks. 
Even if the temp is low, about 40c. 
Tested disconnecting fan an noticed that tem is till close to 40c. 
So made this circuit to low down fan to half (no noice) in non demanding mode. 
Still the temp is 40s. However as cooling demand rises, fan will go back to normal oprations.
